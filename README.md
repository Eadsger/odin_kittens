# Kittens API

Welcome to the Kittens API project! This is a simple and fast project where you'll set up a Rails app to function as a data-producing API. In other words, your controller methods will render data instead of HTML. This project is aimed at giving you practice in quickly building a pure vanilla RESTful resource.
